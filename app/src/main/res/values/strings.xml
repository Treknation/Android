        &lt;b>How does Express Entry Work?&lt;/b>&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        1. Express Entry works by submitting an online profile for determining eligibility for the one of the below programs:&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        	•  Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)&lt;br /&gt;
            •  Canadian Experience Class (CEC)&lt;br /&gt;
            •  Federal Skilled Trades (FST)&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        2. You can enter details about your age, education, work experience and language score to gain CRS(Comprehensive Ranking System) score.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        3. You are then placed in the Express Entry pool and ranked relative to each other based on your CRS score.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        4. You will be invited to apply for the permanent residence if your score is above the cut off score for that draw. This invitation is also called Invitation to Apply(ITA). A draw is conducted generally twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b>How much does Express Entry cost?&lt;/b> &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Express Entry generally costs $1325 CAD. There is an additional cost of $1325 CAD if your application has a spouse. There is also a fee of $225 CAD per dependent child in the application. This is just the fee charged by IRCC and there are other costs as well associated with education verification, language test, medical test and police verification which you will find in relevant sections.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b>How long does it take?&lt;/b> &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        It usually takes 6 months after you receive your ITA.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        It may take additional time for other processes such as educational document verification, police verification, medical test and language test. These processes can take up to an additional 9 weeks.

    <string name="eca_long_description">
        &lt;b>What is ECA?&lt;/b>&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        An Educational Credential Assessment (ECA) is used to verify that your foreign degree, diploma, or certificate (or other proof of your credential) is valid and equal to a Canadian one.
        For example, an ECA will determine if an applicant’s foreign Master’s degree is of the same standard when compared to a Canadian Master’s degree.
        You would need an ECA only if you have a non-Canadian degree.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        In most cases, you will only need an assessment of your highest educational qualification but you can get an assessment for 2 or more credentials if it increases your CRS score.
        If your post-secondary credentials do not have a Canadian equivalent then you can get your secondary credentials assessed.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b>How to get one?&lt;/b>&lt;br /&gt;
        You must get your assessment either from an Organization or from a Body designated by the IRCC. They will give you a report that tells you what your education is equal to in Canada.
        Make sure that the assessment is issued for Immigration Purpose since there are multiple types of ECA&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Designated Organization:&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Comparative Education Service – University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies&lt;br /&gt;
        • International Credential Assessment Service of Canada&lt;br /&gt;
        • World Education Services&lt;br /&gt;
        • International Qualifications Assessment Service (IQAS)&lt;br /&gt;
        • International Credential Evaluation Service&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Designated Profession Bodies.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Medical Council of Canada (professional body for doctors) - For specialist physicians and general practitioners (NOC 3111 or NOC 3112).&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada (professional body for pharmacists) - For pharmacists (NOC 3131).&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        An ECA is valid for a period of 5 years from the date it is issued.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Costs and Processing time:
        Cost to get an assessment range between 200$ to 220$ depending on the organization you get the assessment from. The processing times vary as per the organizations shown below

    <string name="pool_long_desc">
        Please make sure you have completed the below steps before proceeding to create your profile:&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        1. ECA from Step 2&lt;br /&gt;
        2. Language Test details from Step 3&lt;br /&gt;
        3. Personal preference code from the Eligibility form in Step 4&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        In order to create an express entry profile, you would need to create a GC Key account.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Steps&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Increasing the points with the language test is the easiest and surest way of increasing the CRS score. So, it\'s best if you give the language test after sufficient practice. For example, increasing your score from CLB 7 to CLB 9 in each section increases your score by 14 points per section. So, in total your points increase by a total of 56 (14 x 4).
        • You can also earn extra points for your Secondary language abilities. You can earn 4 additional points if you get the score in the below range:&lt;br /&gt;
            o   Speaking, Listening and Writing: CLB 		5 - CLB 9&lt;br /&gt;
            o   Reading: CLB 4 - CLB 9&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Education Points&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Create GC key account by going to this page(Please do not choose sign in with partner account) . Please remember the 4 security questions and answers thoroughly since you will be asked each time you log in.&lt;br /&gt;

    </string>


    <string name="ita_long_desc">
        CIC conducts EE draws twice a month. Regardless of the program, you are applying for, you will get a CRS score. The score ranks you in the applicant pool using the CRS score with other candidates. The Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration decides the cut-off of each draw.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If your CRS score is greater than or equal to the cut-off, you will get an Invitation to Apply (ITA). You can see the ITA in the corresponding section of the Express Entry profile. Once you receive the ITA you will be eligible to apply for Permanent Residence.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Previous draws can give you an indication of your chances in the next draw, but it does not guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If you are eligible for more than one program you will be invited for one program based on this order&lt;br /&gt;
        • Canadian Experience Class (CEC),&lt;br /&gt;
        • Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) program, then&lt;br /&gt;
        • Federal Skilled Trades (FST) program&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        Once you receive the ITA you can either:&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Accept it - If you choose to accept it you will have 60 days to apply for your Permanent Residence&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • Decline it - If you choose to decline your profile will be moved back to the application pool&lt;br /&gt;

        • Do no respond - If you do not respond your profile will expire and you will no longer be eligible for future draws&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If you accept the ITA you will need to -&lt;br /&gt;
        Fill out a form similar to ones in the Express Entry profile. Instructions to fill out the form are mentioned in the ITA pdf file received in the messages section of your profile. You will be asked for additional details. For e.g. Provide Address and Travel history for the past 10 years or from your 18th birthday. You would need to provide a Letter of Explanation if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;
        Once you submit the form a personalized document checklist will be created which you can cover in the next steps.

    <string name="checklist_long_desc">
        Once you fill out the post ITA application forms a personalized document checklist is created for you. Since you only have 60 days to gather all documents and to submit them we recommend starting the process ASAP so that you can avoid delays.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        The document checklist is mostly made up of the following section. You would need to upload documents in each of these sections. You would need to make sure that the size of the file is no larger than 4 MB. The file formats you can upload are .tiff, .jpg, .png, .doc, .docx and .pdf.&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;b>Identification documents&lt;/b>&lt;br /&gt;

        &lt;b>Tips&lt;/b>&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If one of your documents is in a language other than English or French, you must also upload:&lt;br /&gt;
        • An English or French translation&lt;br /&gt;
        • A certified photocopy of the original document&lt;br /&gt;
        • An affidavit from the person who completed the translation (if they’re not a certified translator)&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If a certified translator completed your translation:&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        • The document must be stamped with the translator’s certification or registration number&lt;br /&gt;
        • You can indicate that you’re not providing an affidavit because a certified translator completed the translation (write a letter and scan it with your translated document)&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;br /&gt;
        If you feel like a document you are submitting might raise the slightest question from an immigration officer, you should add a Letter of Explanation (LoE) (sample in the link) to your documents. For example, if it concerns your passport section, then add your LoE to the PDF file that you will upload to the passport section.&lt;br /&gt;
